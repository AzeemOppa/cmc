\begin{definition}
  Let
    $d \in \N$,
    $K$ be a quasi-cubical mesh of dimension $d$,
    $p \in \{0, ..., d\}$.
  The \textbf{inner product of $p$-cochains}
  $\inner{\cdot}{\cdot}_p \colon C^p K \times C^p K \to C^p K$
  is defined as follows.
  If $b_p \in K_p$, then
  \begin{equation}
    \inner{b^p}{b^p}_p :=
    \frac{1}{2^d \mu(b_p)} \sum_{c_{d - p} \perp b_p} \mu(c_{d - p}).
  \end{equation}
  The inner product between two different $p$-cochains in the standard basis is
  defined to be zero
  (hence, the standard cochain basis is an orthogonal basis with respect to the
  inner product).
  Extending by bilinearity, we define the inner product of arbitrary
  $p$-cochains (since we already have it for pairs of basis $p$-cochains).

  The operator $\inner{\cdot}{\cdot}_p$ has physical dimension $[L^{d - 2 p}]$.
\end{definition}
