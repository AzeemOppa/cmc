\begin{remark}
  The above proposition says that the boundary operator is essentially unique,
  i.e., up to isomorphism it does not depend on the chosen relative orientation.
  This motivates the notion of ``\emph{the} boundary operator'' on a mesh.
  Nevertheless, this does not exclude special choices of relative orientations
  in some particular cases like compatibly orientable meshes or regular grids.
