\begin{definition}
  \label{cmc:mesh:definition}
  Let $d$ be a natural number.
  A \textbf{mesh}
  of dimension $d$ is a finite set of polytopes of dimension at
  most $d$ such that:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      if $X$ is an element of $M$, then all subfaces of $X$ are also in $M$;
    \item
      the intersection of elements of $M$ is a finite (possibly empty) union of
      elements of $M$.
  \end{itemize}
  For an integer $p \in [0, d]$, the set of elements (polytopes) of dimension
  $p$ in $M$ is denoted by $M_p$.
\end{definition}
