\begin{definition}
  Let $d\in \N$ and $M$ be a mesh of dimension $d$.
  We say that $M$ is \textbf{flat} if the following conditions are satisfied:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      it is pure, i.e., all of its cells lie within some $d$-cell;
    \item
      all its cells are flat (but possibly degenerate) polytopes;
    \item
      it can be embedded in $\R^d$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
