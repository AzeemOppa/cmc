\begin{discussion}
  The quantities participating in the classical electromagnetism are given in
  \Cref{table:electromagnetism/continuous/quantities}.
  The Maxwell's equations and the Poynting's theorem are given in
  \Cref{table:electromagnetism/continuous/laws}.
  The linear constitutive laws in the macroscopic formulation are given in
  \Cref{table:electromagnetism/continuous/constitutive_relations}.
  (Note that $\mu = \mu_0$ and $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_0$ in the microscopic
  formulation.
  Conductivity is not used there since $J$ is given.)
