\begin{remark}
   Let
    $R$ be a commutative ring with unity,
    $D \in \N$,
    $V$ be a free module over $R$ of dimension $D$,
    $e_0, ..., e_{D - 1}$ be a basis of $V$.
  The elements of $S(e)$ which are wedge products of $p$ vectors are called
  \textbf{$p$-vectors}.
  Obviously, there are $\binom{D}{p}$ of them.
  Denote by $\Lambda^p V$ the space spanned by those $p$ vectors
  (it does not depend on the basis of $e$ -- in fact $\Lambda^p V$ is the space
  spanned by linear combinations of wedge products of arbitrary vectors).
  Then we have the module decomposition
  \begin{equation}
    \Lambda^\bullet V := \sum_{p = 0}^D \Lambda^p V.
  \end{equation}
  This decompositions turns $\Lambda^\bullet V$ into a graded algebra, that is
  for each $p, q \in \N$,
  \begin{equation}
    \omega_p \in \Lambda^p V,\ \eta_q \in \Lambda^q V
    \Rightarrow \omega_p \wedge \eta_q \in \Lambda^{p + q} V
  \end{equation}
  (here we define $\Lambda^r = 0$ for $r > D$).
\end{remark}
