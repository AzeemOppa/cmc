\begin{remark}
  On a non-oriented real inner product space $V$ of dimension $d \in \N$
  there are exactly two elements $\omega, \eta \in\Lambda^d V^*$ that have norm
  $1$ (they are opposite to one another, i.e., $\omega = -\eta$) and so are
  candidates for a volume $d$-vector.
  Choosing one of them is equivalent to a choice of orientation on $V$.
\end{remark}
