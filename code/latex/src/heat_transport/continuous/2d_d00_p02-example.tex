\begin{example}
  Consider the steady-state continuous heat transport problem
  (\Cref{idec/heat_transport/continuous/primal_strong_steady_state-formulation},
   \Cref{idec/heat_transport/continuous/primal_weak_steady_state-formulation},
   \Cref{idec/heat_transport/continuous/mixed_weak_steady_state-formulation})
  with input data \verb|2d_d00_p02| in the nomenclature of the C codebase.

  Concretely, $X = [0, 1]^2$, $\kappa_1 \equiv 1$, $f = -4 \, d x \wedge d y$,
  $G_D = \partial X$, $G_N = \emptyset$, $g_D(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$.

  This problem has the following exact solution:
  \begin{subequations}
    \begin{alignat}{3}
      & u(x, y) && = && x^2 + y^2, \\
      & q(x, y) && = && - 2 y\, d x + 2 x\, d y.
    \end{alignat}
  \end{subequations}
  Consider a mesh $M$ for $X$ consisting of $10 \times 10$ squares (each axis is
  divided into $10$ segments) with Forman subdivision $K$ ($20 \times 20$
  squares).
  Its potential and flow on $K$ consisting of the exact solution and the $3$
  discussed cochain methods is shown on
  \Cref{figure:idec/diffusion/steady_state_continuous_2d_d00_p02/brick_2d_10_forman}.
