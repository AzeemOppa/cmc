\begin{example}
  Consider the steady-state continuous heat transport problem
  (\Cref{idec/heat_transport/continuous/primal_strong_steady_state-formulation},
   \Cref{idec/heat_transport/continuous/primal_weak_steady_state-formulation},
   \Cref{idec/heat_transport/continuous/mixed_weak_steady_state-formulation})
  with input data \verb|2d_d00_p01| in the nomenclature of the C codebase.

  Concretely,
    $X = [0, 1]^2$,
    $\kappa_1 \equiv 1$,
    $f \equiv 0$,
    $G_D = \{0, 1\} \times [0, 1]$,
    $G_N = [0, 1] \times \{0, 1\}$,
    $g_D(x, y) = \begin{cases} -100, & x = 0 \\ 100, & x = 1 \end{cases}$,
    $g_N \equiv 0$.

  This problem has the following exact solution:
  \begin{subequations}
    \begin{alignat}{3}
      & u(x, y) && = && 100 (2 x - 1), \\
      & q(x, y) && = && 200\, d y.
    \end{alignat}
  \end{subequations}
  Consider a mesh $M$ for $X$ consisting of $2 \times 2$ squares (each axis is
  divided into $2$ segments) with Forman subdivision $K$ ($4 \times 4$ squares).
  Its potential and flow on $K$ consisting of the exact solution and the $3$
  discussed cochain methods are shown on
  \Cref{figure:idec/diffusion/steady_state/continuous_2d_d00_p01/brick_2d_2_forman}.
