\begin{proof}
  Let $D, D_1, D_2 \in {\rm Der}_R(A)$.
  Then $D_1 + D_2$ is a homomorphism from module theory.
  To prove it satisfies the Leibniz rule, let $a, b \in A$.
  Then
  \begin{equation}
    (D_1 + D_2)(a * b)
    = D_1(a * b) + D_2(a * b)
    = D_1 a * b + a * D_1 b + D_2 a * b + a * D_2 b
    = (D_1 + D_2) a * b + a * (D_1 + D_2) b.
  \end{equation}
  Further, let $a \in A$.
  Then $(a \cdot D)(b) := a * D b$ for any $b \in B$.
  It is trivial to check it it is a homomorphism.
  To check it is a derivation, let $b, c \in A$.
  Then
  \begin{equation}
    (a \cdot D)(b * c)
    = a * D(b * c)
    = a * (D b * c + b * D c)
    = (a * D b) * c + b * (a * D c)
    = (a \cdot D) b * c + b * (a \cdot D) c. 
  \end{equation}
  Hence, ${\rm Der}_R(A)$ is an $A$-module.
\end{proof}
