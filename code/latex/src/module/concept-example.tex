\begin{example}
  Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity.
  The following are examples of modules over $R$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      For any $n \in \N$, the space $R^n$ is a module over $R$ under
      component-wise addition and multiplication with a scalar.
    \item
      For any $m, n \in \N$, the space $M_{m \times n}(R)$ of $m \times n$
      matrices with elements in $R$ is a module over $R$ under under
      component-wise addition and multiplication with a scalar.
    \item
      For any set $X$, the ring $R^X$ can also be considered as a module over
      $R$ with pointwise addition and multiplication with a scalar.
      It generalises the previous two cases when $X = \{1, ..., n\}$ and
      $X = \{1, ..., m\} \times \{1, ..., n\}$ respectively.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}
