\begin{definition}
  Let $n > 0$.
  A \hyperref[cmc:jagged:definition]{jagged array}
  of order $n$ is represented in memory by a structure of $n + 1$
  fields as follows:
  an integer $a_0$,
  $n - 1$ pointers $a_1, ..., a_{n - 1}$ to integer
  (any of them points to the  $0$-th element of an array of integers),
  a pointer $a_n$ to the $0$-th element of an array of type $T$.

  The fields $a_0, ..., a_{n - 1}$ represent the internal structure,
  while $a_n$ holds the values.
  More precisely, let $x$ be a jagged array of order $n$.
  $a_0$ is the number of its elements of order $n - 1$.
  For $i = 0, ..., a_0 - 1$,
  $a_1[i]$ represents the number of elements of order $n - 2$ in $x[i]$.
  There are totally $b_2 = a_1[0] + ... a_1[a_0 - 1]$ elements of order $n - 2$.
  For $i = 0, ..., a_0 - 1$, $j  = 0, ..., a_1[i] - 1$,
  $a_2[a_1[0] + ... + a_1[i - 1] + j]$
  is the number of its elements of order $n - 3$ in $x[i][j]$.
  Continue in the same manner for higher orders.
  Finally, $a_n$ represents the flattened version of $x$.
