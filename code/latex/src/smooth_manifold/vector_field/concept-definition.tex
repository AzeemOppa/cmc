\begin{definition}
  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold.
  A \textbf{vector field} on $M$ is a \textbf{derivation} on the $\R$-algebra
  $\mathcal{F} M$ of smooth functions.
  In other words, a vector field is an $\R$-linear map
  $X \colon \mathcal{F} M \to \mathcal{F} M$ such that for any
  $f, g \in \mathcal{F} M$ the \textbf{Leibniz rule} is satisfied:
  \begin{equation}
    X(f g) = f \cdot (X g) + (X f) \cdot g
  \end{equation}
  (here $\cdot$ is multiplication of functions).

  The space of all vector fields on $M$ is denoted by $\mathfrak{X} M$.
  It is an $\R$-algebra under pointwise addition and multiplication with scalar.
  It is also an $(\mathcal{F} M)$-algebra with the following multiplication with
  a function: for any $f \in \mathfrak{X} M$ and $X \in \mathcal{F} M$,
  $f X \in \mathcal{F} M$ is defined to act on $g \in \mathcal{F} M$ by
  \begin{equation}
    (f X) g := f \cdot (X g).
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
