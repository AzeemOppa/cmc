  Consider the steady-state continuous heat transport problem
  (\Cref{cmc/diffusion/continuous/steady_state/primal_strong-formulation},
   \Cref{cmc/diffusion/continuous/steady_state/primal_weak-formulation},
   \Cref{cmc/diffusion/continuous/steady_state/mixed_weak-formulation})
  with input data \verb|2d_d00_p02| in the nomenclature of the C codebase.

  Concretely,
    $X = [0, 1]^2$,
    $\tilde{\kappa} \equiv 1$,
    $f = -4 \, d x \wedge d y$,
    $G_D = \partial X$,
    $G_N = \emptyset$,
    $g_D(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$.

  This problem has the following exact solution:
  \begin{subequations}
    \begin{alignat}{3}
      & u(x, y) && = && x^2 + y^2, \\
      & q(x, y) && = && 2 y\, d x - 2 x\, d y.
    \end{alignat}
  \end{subequations}
  Consider a mesh $M$ for $X$ consisting of $10 \times 10$ squares (each axis is
  divided into $10$ segments) with Forman subdivision $K$ ($20 \times 20$
  squares).
  Its potential and flow rate on $K$ consisting of the exact solution and the
  $3$ discussed cochain methods are shown on
  \Cref{figure:cmc/diffusion/steady_state/continuous_2d_d00_p02/brick_2d_10_forman_potential}
  and
  \Cref{figure:cmc/diffusion/steady_state/continuous_2d_d00_p02/brick_2d_10_forman_flow_rate}.
