\begin{example}
  Consider the steady-state continuous heat transport problem
  (\Cref{idec/diffusion/continuous/steady_state/primal_strong-formulation},
   \Cref{idec/diffusion/continuous/steady_state/primal_weak-formulation},
   \Cref{idec/diffusion/continuous/steady_state/mixed_weak-formulation})
  with input data \verb|2d_d00_p05| in the nomenclature of the C codebase.

  Concretely,
    $X = [0, 1]^2$,
    $\kappa_1 \equiv 1$,
    $f(x, y) = \sin(\pi x) \sin(\pi y) \, d x \wedge d y$,
    $G_D = \partial X$,
    $G_N = \emptyset$,
    $g_D \equiv 0$.

  This problem has the following exact solution:
  \begin{subequations}
    \begin{alignat}{3}
      & u(x, y) && = && \frac{\sin(\pi x) \sin(\pi y)}{2 \pi^2}, \\
      & q(x, y) && = &&
        \frac{1}{2 \pi}
        ((- \sin(\pi x) \cos(\pi y) \, d x + \sin(\pi y) \cos(\pi x)\, d y)).
    \end{alignat}
  \end{subequations}
  Consider a mesh $M$ for $X$ consisting of $5 \times 5$ squares (each axis is
  divided into $5$ segments) with Forman subdivision $K$
  ($10 \times 10$ squares).
  Its potential and flow on $K$ consisting of the exact solution and the $3$
  discussed cochain methods are shown on
  \Cref{figure:idec/diffusion/steady_state/continuous_2d_d00_p05/brick_2d_5_forman}.
