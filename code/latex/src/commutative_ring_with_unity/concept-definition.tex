\begin{definition}
  Let
    $R$ be a set,
    $0, 1 \in R$,
    $- \colon R \to R$
    $+, * \colon R \times R \to R$.
  We say that $(R, 0, 1, -, +, *)$ is a \textbf{commutative ring with unity}
  (we will simply say that $R$ is commutative ring with unity when operations
  are clear from the context) if the following equalities are satisfied
  for all $a, b, c \in R$:
  \begin{subequations}
    \begin{alignat}{2}
      & a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c \qquad
      && (\text{addition is associative}), \\
      %
      & a + 0 = 0 + a = a \qquad
      && (\text{$0$ is neutral with respect to addition}), \\
      %
      & a + (- a) = (- a) + a = 0 \qquad
      && (\text{negation is the inverse of addition}), \\
      %
      & a + b = b + a \qquad
      && (\text{addition is commutative}), \\
      %
      & a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c \qquad
      && (\text{multiplication is left-distributive over addition}), \\
      %
      & (a + b) * c = a * c + b * c \qquad
      && (\text{multiplication is right-distributive over addition}), \\
      %
      & a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c \qquad
      && (\text{multiplication is associative}), \\
      %
      & a * 1 = 1 * a = a \qquad
      && (\text{$1$ is neutral with respect to multiplication}), \\
      %
      & a * b = b * a \qquad
      && (\text{multiplication is commutative}).
    \end{alignat}
  \end{subequations}
  We will often omit multiplication sign and write $a b$ instead of $a * b$.
\end{definition}
