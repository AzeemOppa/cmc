\begin{remark}
  The reason for introducing commutative rings with unity instead of working
  with fields is that, as explained above, sets of functions $R^X$ are not
  fields.
  We will encounter them a lot when working with algebraic structures on smooth
  manifolds and meshes, predominantly modules over subrings of $R^X$.
