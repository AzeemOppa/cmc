\begin{example}
  The following are examples and counterexamples of fields.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      Among the number sets, $\Q$, $\R$, $\C$ are fields, $\Z$ is not a field.
    \item
      Let $n$ be an integer.
      Then $\Z_n$ is a field if and only if $n$ is a prime number.
    \item
      Let $X$ be a nonempty set, $R$ be a field.
      Then the set of functions $R^X := \set{f}{f \colon X \to R}$ is not a
      field except in the trivial case of $X$ having one element.
      Indeed, let $X$ has at least two elements, and take a function $f \in R^X$
      that is zero at a point $x_0$ but nonzero at some other point $x_1$
      (so it is not identically zero).
      Then $f$ is not invertible since for any $g \in R^X$,
      \begin{equation}
        (f * g)(x_0) = f(x_0) * g(x_0) = 0 * g(x_0) = 0 \neq 1.
      \end{equation}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}
