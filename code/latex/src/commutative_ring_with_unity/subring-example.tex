\begin{example}
  The following are examples of subrings.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      The number sets $\Z$, $\Q$, $\R$, $\C$ form a chain of subrings
      (any of them is a subring with unity of the next one).
    \item
      For any $n \in \N,\ n \geq 2$, the set $n \Z := \set{n x}{x \in \Z}$ is a
      subring of $\Z$ that has no unity.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}
