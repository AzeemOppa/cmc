\begin{definition}
  Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity.
  We say that $R$ is a \textbf{field} if it has at least two elements and any
  nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse, i.e.,
  \begin{equation}
    \forall a \in R \setminus \{0\}\ \exists b \in R,\ a * b = 1.
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
